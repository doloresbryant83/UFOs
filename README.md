## Overview of Project: 

This project using JavaScript to create a table to organize UFO data.  The table has the ability to filter data based on a set of five criteria.

## Results:

Click the UFO Sightinngs Button at the top left corner to refresh the main page:

![main_page](https://github.com/doloresbryant83/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/main_page.png)

To filter the criteria by date, input a date in the text box:

![date_filter](https://github.com/doloresbryant83/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/date_filter.png)

To filter the city data, input a city in the text box:

![city_filter](https://github.com/doloresbryant83/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/city_filter.png)

To filter the State Data, input a state in the text box:

![state_filter](https://github.com/doloresbryant83/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/state_filter.png)

To filter the Shape Data, input a shape in the text box:

![shape_filter](https://github.com/doloresbryant83/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/shape_filter.png)

## Summary: 
- The drawback of this webpage is that you have to be familiar with the filters that are in the database.  

- I would make the recommendation to input a drop downbox to filter the data.  
- I would also make the recommendation to create hyperlinks on the mainpage and nest the comments in they hyperlink.
